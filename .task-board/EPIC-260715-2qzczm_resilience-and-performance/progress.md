Logbook 2026-07-15: Existing M0 through M2 board items already own SSH engine selection, packet bridge acceptance, baseline TCP and safe-DNS startup, relay resource bounds, and full or degraded capability semantics. M3 links to those gates instead of duplicating them. The M3 critical path is lane pool -> windows and memory -> reconnect -> QUIC and route modes -> NAT64 and lifecycle -> baseline and tuning. A parent dependency cycle was prevented by assigning the generic atomic settings transaction to reconnect and the compatible or fail-closed builder composition to route-mode integration. All numeric policy values remain evidence gates. HEV fork work is conditional on Instruments proof and has a pre-created blocked implementation task.
Handoff logbook: the first to-review transition was rejected by three auto-escalated epic summary dependencies even though this role produced planning artifacts rather than implementation. The epic-level summary edges were removed, while every exact upstream task blocker and all story-level execution blockers remain. Board validation still passes and representative tasks remain computed blocked until their real prerequisites close.
