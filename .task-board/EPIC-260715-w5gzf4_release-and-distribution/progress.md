## Notes
spawn queued: [analyst] solution-architect (codex) (run=RUN-260715-79f57e, max_parallel=20)
spawn run started: [analyst] solution-architect (codex) (run=RUN-260715-79f57e)
Solution-architecture logbook 2026-07-15: created a 67-task planning-only decomposition with 249 exact dependencies. Key boundaries: CI before M5 relay supply chain; audited relay staging before parallel macOS/iOS distribution; exact candidate evidence before privacy/legal/App Review operations. Stable private GitHub assets require authenticated retrieval. Relay bytes are bit-for-bit reproducible; Apple signed outputs use reproducible unsigned inputs plus exact signed provenance. Regional VPN licensing, current Apple guidance, public privacy/export declarations, release credentials, and review fixture are explicit blocking tasks. Board validation and canonical plan pass. Graphviz PNG rendering is currently unavailable because dot cannot load libltdl.7.dylib; authoritative DOT/PlantUML sources are attached. No implementation or source/specification edit was performed.
Decomposition summary attached: EPIC-260715-w5gzf4_decomposition-summary.md. Five stories are to-dev and unassigned; 67 atomic tasks remain backlog; 249 exact task dependencies produce the canonical four-phase plan. Explicit external decision gates and the Graphviz renderer anomaly are documented.
Planning handoff representation 2026-07-15: removed only four auto-escalated EPIC-level summary blockers so this planning epic can enter to-review. All 249 exact task dependencies and all story-level upstream blockers remain, preserving Gate A0/P0, M1, M2, M4, CI, relay, macOS, iOS, and review execution order.
