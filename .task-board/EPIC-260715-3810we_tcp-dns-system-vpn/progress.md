## Notes
spawn queued: [analyst] solution-architect (codex) (run=RUN-260715-7e3c91, max_parallel=20)
spawn run started: [analyst] solution-architect (codex) (run=RUN-260715-7e3c91)
Solution-architect handoff: refined all five stories and created 54 atomic backlog tasks with explicit in/out scope, five numbered AC, and three task-specific handoff items each. Added 135 direct within-M1 dependencies. Exact M0 handoffs are attached as task precondition resources rather than unfinished cross-epic blockers. Canonical path is shared runtime -> SSH auth -> TCP -> DNS/routing -> provider lifecycle and physical iPhone/Mac acceptance. TASK-260715-1tnjlu is the explicit unblocked resolver-policy decision. Attached canonical plan, decomposition summary, logbook, task-scoped dependency and startup diagrams, and Graphviz environment anomaly. No implementation or source/specification edit was performed.
