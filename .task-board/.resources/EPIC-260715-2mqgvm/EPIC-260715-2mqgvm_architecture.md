# System architecture

## Context

The containing app manages profiles and the system VPN configuration. A packet
tunnel extension owns the complete live transport. It terminates device TCP in a
userspace stack, opens corresponding SSH `direct-tcpip` channels, and sends
framed UDP datagrams to a rootless relay launched through an SSH exec channel.

```

The only user-payload transport between the Apple device and the selected exit
host is SSH. Normal SSH TCP control traffic is visible to the access network;
payload destinations and contents are protected by SSH up to the exit host.

## Runtime components

### Containing apps

The iOS app and macOS app provide profile editing, key import/generation,
host-key confirmation, VPN installation, connect/disconnect, status, and
diagnostics. They use `NETunnelProviderManager` to manage the custom VPN profile.
They are not part of the live packet path.

### Packet tunnel extensions

Each platform embeds an `NEPacketTunnelProvider` target. The provider owns:

- route and DNS settings;
- `NEPacketTunnelFlow` reads and writes;
- the packet bridge and HEV/lwIP instance;
- the internal SOCKS adapter;
- SSH lane connections and channels;
- remote relay installation and session;
- reconnect, memory pressure, and capability state machines.

The iOS and macOS providers share `ReluxTunnelCore` as a Swift package. Platform
adapters remain thin and do not duplicate the packet or SSH state machines.

### Packet plane

`NEPacketTunnelFlow` exchanges packets with HEV/lwIP through a documented
`AF_UNIX/SOCK_DGRAM` socket pair. HEV terminates TCP locally and speaks an
in-process SOCKS contract to `SSHProxyAdapter`.

### SSH transport

`SSHTransport` abstracts the chosen in-process engine. It provides authenticated
connections, `direct-tcpip`, exec channels, host-key evidence, transport metrics,
rekey controls, and per-channel window configuration. It does not provide SFTP.

### Remote relay

`relux-relay` is a small bundled program uploaded through an authenticated exec
channel and launched with `--stdio`. It performs only UDP socket operations,
protocol framing, bounded association tracking, and health reporting. It does
not require root, persist as a daemon, or open a listening port.

## Data paths

### TCP

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant OS as Device TCP
    participant LWIP as HEV/lwIP
    participant Adapter as SSHProxyAdapter
    participant SSH as SSH lane
    participant Dest as Destination
    OS->>LWIP: IP/TCP packets
    LWIP->>Adapter: SOCKS CONNECT(host, port)
    Adapter->>SSH: direct-tcpip channel
    SSH->>Dest: New remote TCP connection
    Dest-->>SSH: Remote byte stream
    SSH-->>Adapter: Channel byte stream
    Adapter-->>LWIP: SOCKS byte stream
    LWIP-->>OS: Locally generated TCP packets
```

The original TCP connection terminates in lwIP. The SSH server opens a distinct
destination TCP connection. This avoids nesting an intact TCP congestion loop
inside SSH's TCP connection, although all flows on one SSH lane still share its
head-of-line blocking.

### UDP and DNS

HEV uses its UDP-in-TCP SOCKS extension. `SSHProxyAdapter` preserves the HEV
datagram address framing where practical and forwards it through the relay exec
channel. The relay opens real UDP sockets on the exit host and returns replies
with the same association identity.

DNS uses a tunnel-controlled resolver path. It never falls back silently to the
physical interface. In degraded mode it uses DNS-over-TCP through
`direct-tcpip` or a configured DoH endpoint through the tunnel.

## Control and state ownership

The extension is the authority for live state. The containing app persists
profiles and requests actions but derives connection status from
`NETunnelProviderSession` plus a versioned app-message snapshot. Shared mutable
state is limited to an App Group configuration snapshot and Keychain references.

## Platform-intent gate

Apple documents packet tunnel providers as packet-oriented custom VPNs whose
packets are sent to a tunnel server. Apple Technical Note TN3120 warns against
claiming packet traffic and proxying it through another interface. Relux's
local TCP termination followed by SSH `direct-tcpip` may be interpreted as that
discouraged model even though SSH is the custom tunnel and the exit is remote.

**Gate A0:** before product implementation proceeds beyond a disposable spike,
obtain evidence that this architecture is acceptable for the intended Network
Extension entitlement and App Store distribution. Evidence may be a written
Apple Developer Technical Support response, successful entitlement/review
feedback for an accurately disclosed prototype, or an architecture change that
sends packet semantics to a remote VPN endpoint. This is a release viability
gate, not a hidden implementation assumption.
