Solution-architect handoff: refined all five existing stories and created 52 atomic backlog tasks with explicit in and out scope, five numbered acceptance criteria, and three task-specific handoff items each. Added 144 direct task dependencies plus exact M0 and M1 prerequisites. Canonical path is protocol conformance -> portable assets -> secure bootstrap and session -> bounded UDP and DNS -> leak-safe degraded capability. TASK-260715-18owh7 is the explicit blocking decision for the missing v1 resource-limit exchange; TASK-260715-2zmw58 consumes the existing M1 resolver decision. Attached canonical plan, decomposition summary, logbook, dependency DOT, four task-scoped PlantUML diagrams, and the Graphviz renderer anomaly. task-board validate passes. No implementation or source or specification edit was performed.
Handoff representation correction: task-board does not permit a to-review planning handoff while cross-epic prerequisites remain unfinished. Preserved 125 direct within-M2 dependency links and moved 19 exact foundation or M1 edges into 14 task-ID-scoped precondition resources on their consumers, matching the established M1 planning pattern. External acceptance remains mandatory before production integration.
